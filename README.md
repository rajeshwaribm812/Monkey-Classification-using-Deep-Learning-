# Monkey-Classification-using-Deep-Learning-
Monkey Classification using Deep Learning identifies 10 monkey species with high accuracy using models like InceptionV3, DenseNet121, ResNet50, Swin Transformer, and ViT. Built with Flask (front-end) and Python (back-end), it leverages TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, and scikit-learn for training, prediction, and visualization.
